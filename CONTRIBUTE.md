 ## :book: Code of Conduct
  - Be constructive in your criticism
    
 ## :bulb: Asking Questions

  - Write to us either by email or here on GitHub. Contact information can be found in the README.md file
  - As this is a school project, the maintainance and support for this program will be very limitied.

## :inbox_tray: Opening an Issue
  - Make a new branch
  - Create a pull request
  - Only solve one issue pr. pull request
  - Sit back relax and wait

### :lock: Reporting Security Issues
    - Make sure you make the pull-request private, so only the admin team can see it and resolve the issue
